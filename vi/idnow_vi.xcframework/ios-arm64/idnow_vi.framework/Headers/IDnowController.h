/**
 *  The main class of the SDK. It provides functionality to instantiate a new
 *  identification process and presents the UI needed for a video or photo ident.
 *
 *  First you should create an IDnowSettings object, which should contain at least a transactionToken and a companyID.
 *  You can customize the identification process by setting some of the additional properties of the IDnowSettings instance.
 *  For more information take a look at the IDnowSettings class.
 *
 *  Create an instance by calling initWithSettings:, adding the created IDnowSettings object as parameter.
 *
 *  To start an identification you can call initializeWithCompletionBlock:.
 *  The completion block will contain additional information of success or failure of the initialization.
 *  For more information take a look at IDnowCompletionBlock.
 *  Alternatively you can set the delegate property and call initialize to get informed about success or failure.
 *  For more information take a look at IDnowControllerDelegate.
 *
 *  When the initialization failed, you will receive an error object, that contains additional information about the error.
 *  E.g. you can show an UIAlertView / UIAlertController taking the localizedDescription into account.
 *
 *  When the initialization was successful, you can start the identification process by
 *  calling startIdentificationFromViewController:presentModal:withCompletionBlock:.
 *  The completion block will contain additional information of success or failure of the identification process.
 *  For more information take a look at IDnowCompletionBlock.
 *  Alternatively you can set the delegate property and call startIdentificationFromViewController:presentModal:
 *  to get information about success or failure.
 *  For more information take a look at IDnowControllerDelegate.
 *
 *  When the identification failed the success value of the completion block will be set to false and you will receive an error object,
 *  that contains additional information about the error.
 *  The errors are automatically handled by the SDK, so you don't have to display an extra alert to the user.
 *
 *  When the identification was canceled by the user the canceledByUser value will be true (see IDnowCompletionBlock)
 *  or you will get the appropriate callback from the delegate (see IDnowControllerDelegate).
 *
 *  When the identification was successfull the success value will be set to true (see IDnowCompletionBlock) or you will get the appropriate callback from the delegate (see IDnowControllerDelegate).
