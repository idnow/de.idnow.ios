## Installation

### CocoaPods
- Add the following pod dependencies to your podfile:
```
pod 'IDnowSDK'
```

- Then, run the following command:
```
pod install
```

- Import SDK by using "@import IDnowSDK"

### CocoaPods & XCode 9
As of XCode 9 there might be a chance that you experience a problem with your host apps AppIcon in case you use CocoaPods.
One of the symptoms is that the AppIcon will not be visible if you run your app either on the simulator or a real device. 
There are many reasons why assets/resources are not present (wrong format, transparency, wrong size, ...) but one might be that the auto generated shell script which builds the pods resources misses a flag telling actool the name of the app-icon. 

If you encounter this try to add the following to your projects Podfile exchanging <YOUR_PRODUCT> with the name of your project:

```
post_install do |installer|
    copy_pods_resources_path = "Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-<YOUR_PRODUCT>/Pods-<YOUR_PRODUCT>-resources.sh"
    string_to_replace = '--compile "${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${UNLOCALIZED_RESOURCES_FOLDER_PATH}"'
    assets_compile_with_app_icon_arguments = '--compile "${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${UNLOCALIZED_RESOURCES_FOLDER_PATH}" --app-icon "${ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_APPICON_NAME}" --output-partial-info-plist "${BUILD_DIR}/assetcatalog_generated_info.plist"'
    text = File.read(copy_pods_resources_path)
    new_contents = text.gsub(string_to_replace, assets_compile_with_app_icon_arguments)
    File.open(copy_pods_resources_path, "w") {|file| file.puts new_contents }
end
```

### Manually 
- Add the following pod dependencies to your podfile:
```
pod 'Masonry', '~> 1.0.0'
pod 'SocketRocket', '~> 0.5.1'
pod 'AFNetworking', '~> 3.1.0'
```
- Download the current release from and copy the idnow-sdk folder to your project directory
- Or add the repo as a git submodule (git lfs required. For the initial checkout do git lfs pull)
- Drag idnow-sdk folder into your Xcode project
- Add to your "Link binary with libraries" section
```
Webkit.framework
Accelerate.framework
libz.dylib
```   
- Import 'IDnowSDK.h'

__Note__: To get the sample projects work, you have to call "pod install" to install dependencies.

## Settings (IDnowSettings)

#### companyID
Your company id provided by IDnow.

#### environment
Optional: The environment that should be used for the identification (DEV, TEST, LIVE)
The default value is `IDnowEnvironmentNotDefined`.

By default the value of this property is `false` and the identification UI will be pushed on an existing navigation controller if possible.

#### modalPresentationStyle
Optional: Specifies the presentation style for the modal ident viewcontroller.
E.g. Can be set to `UIModalPresentationCurrentContext` to allow presenting ident view controller within a popover on an iPad.
 
#### apiHost
The target server url for REST calls if custom server is used.

#### websocketHost
The target server url for websocket calls if custom server is used.

## Adding Push Notifications

In order to use push notifications via the IDnow SDK it is neccessary that your own AppDelegate inherits from 
the provided IDnowAppDelegate. This is neccessary since the callbacks form Apple concerning registration and 
reception of push notifications is soley handled through the AppDelegate which is not part of our SDK. In case your
own AppDelegate implements interfaces present in the IDnow SDK please make sure to make a 
call the super classes (IDnowAppDelegate) implementation as well.

Additionally we will need the production certifcate/key pair to send notifications via push to your app via
our backend.

```objective-c

// header
@interface YourAppDelegate : IDnowAppDelegate

@end

// implementation
@implementation YourAppDelegate

- (void)application:(UIApplication*)application didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:(NSError*)error
{
    [super application:application didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:error];
}

- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterUserNotificationSettings:(UIUserNotificationSettings *)notificationSettings
{
	[super application:application didRegisterUserNotificationSettings:notificationSettings];
}

- (void)application:(UIApplication*)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(nonnull NSData*)deviceToken
{
	[super application:application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:deviceToken];
}

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication*)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(nullable NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
	[super application:application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions];
}

- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo
{
	[super application:application didReceiveRemoteNotification:userInfo];
}

- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo
                                                       fetchCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UIBackgroundFetchResult result))completionHandler
{
	[super application:application didReceiveRemoteNotification:userInfo
										 fetchCompletionHandler:completionHandler];
}

@end


```

## Usage example:

```objective-c

// Setup IDnowAppearance
IDnowAppearance *appearance = [IDnowAppearance sharedAppearance];
    
// Adjust colors
appearance.defaultTextColor = [UIColor blackColor];
appearance.primaryBrandColor = [UIColor blueColor];
appearance.proceedButtonBackgroundColor = [UIColor orangeColor];
appearance.failureColor = [UIColor redColor];
appearance.successColor = [UIColor greenColor];
    
// Adjust statusbar
appearance.enableStatusBarStyleLightContent = YES;
    
// Adjust fonts
appearance.fontNameRegular = @"AmericanTypewriter";
appearance.fontNameLight = @"AmericanTypewriter-Light";
appearance.fontNameMedium = @"AmericanTypewriter-CondensedBold";

// To adjust navigation bar / bar button items etc. you should follow Apples UIAppearance protocol.

// Setup IDnowSettings
IDnowSettings *settings = [IDnowSettings settingsWithCompanyID:@"yourCompanyIdentifier"];
settings.transactionToken = @"DEV-TXTXT";

// Initialise and start identification
IDnowController *idnowController = [[IDnowController alloc] initWithSettings: settings];

// Initialize identification using blocks 
// (alternatively you can set the delegate and implement the IDnowControllerDelegate protocol)
[idnowController initializeWithCompletionBlock: ^(BOOL success, NSError *error, BOOL canceledByUser)
{
		if ( success )
		{
		      // Start identification using blocks
			  [idnowController startIdentificationFromViewController: self 
			  withCompletionBlock: ^(BOOL success, NSError *error, BOOL canceledByUser)
			  {
					  if ( success )
					  {
					      // identification was successfull
					  }
					  else
					  {
					      // identification failed / canceled
					  }
				}];
		}
		else if ( error )
		{
		      // Present an alert containing localized error description
			  UIAlertController *alertController = [UIAlertController alertControllerWithTitle: @"Error" 
			  message: error.localizedDescription 
			  preferredStyle: UIAlertControllerStyleAlert];
			  UIAlertAction *action = [UIAlertAction actionWithTitle: @"Ok" 
			  style: UIAlertActionStyleCancel 
			  handler: nil];
			  [alertController addAction: action];
			  [self presentViewController: alertController animated: true completion: nil];
		}
	}];
```

You can also change some of the optional settings:

```objective-c
// Optionally disable success and error screens
settings.showErrorSuccessScreen = NO;
settings.showVideoOverviewCheck = NO;
settings.forceModalPresentation = YES;
settings.showIdentTokenOnCheckScreen = YES;

// Optionally enable custom server with long polling
settings.environment = IDnowEnvironmentCustom;
settings.apiHost = @"https://api.yourserver.com";
settings.websocketHost = @"https://websocket.yourserver.com";
settings.connectionType = IDnowConnectionTypeLongPolling;
```

## Localization
Warning: Adapting localizations is only allowed if you have the permissions from IDnow.

In case you would like to change the localization used by the IDnow SDK at runtime you can do:
Allowed values are: en (English), de (German), fr (French), es (Spanish), it (Italian), pt (Portugese), et (Estonian), hr (Croatian), hu (Hungarian), ka (Georgian), ko(Korean), lt(Lithuanian), lv (Latvian), nl (Dutch), pl (Polish),  ru (Russian), zh (Chinese).
```
settings.userInterfaceLanguage = @"de";
```

English and German Localizations are provided by the SDK (IDnowSDKLocalization.bundle)
You can overwrite localisation in your own Localizable.strings files.


### Example:
```
//Defined in the IDnowSDKLocalization.bundle
"NAVIGATION_ITEM_TITLE_DEFAULT" = "IDnow";

//Overwrite in your Localizable.strings file:
"NAVIGATION_ITEM_TITLE_DEFAULT" = "Video Ident";
```
