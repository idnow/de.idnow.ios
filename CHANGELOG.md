## Changelog

### 9.3.0
- **OTP Step**: We have made the required changes to the flow that allow us to control whether or not the OTP step is displayed to the user.


### 9.2.0

- **Enhanced security validation**: To reduce the chances of a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack over TLS, we have implemented an additional layer of validation. This increases the security of the communication channel between the backend and client side.
- **UI/UX enhancements**: We have made various adjustments to our user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) to ensure users have a consistent experience throughout the flow.
- **Fixed crashes**: As part of this version we have also identified and fixed some crashes to ensure that users can go through the flow uninterrupted.
- **Bug fixes**: We regularly test our products to assess areas where there is any room for improvement. We identified some minor bugs and fixed those as part of this release as well.

### 9.1.1

- We noticed a minor UI inconsistency while using the Picture-in-Picture (PiP) feature that was released in the last version i.e. v9.1.0. As part of this hotfix we have fixed that UI inconsistency.

### 9.1.0

- **Picture-in-Picture (PiP)**: We have release the PiP feature that will show the agent's video feed to the user when the user puts the app in the background. The user will continue to see it unless the flow has been explicitly aborted. We are expecting this to improve agent-user communication and reduce the chances of WebSocket connection dropping. Like most features in our SDK, this is a configurable feature and can be enabled/disabled depending on our customers' choosing.
- **Enhanced security validation**: To reduce the chances of a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack over TLS, we have implemented an additional layer of validation. This increases the security of the communication channel between the backend and client side.

- 
### 8.5.0

### 8.2.0

- **Bug fix**: Ensure that test system works with all test prefixes.


### 8.1.0

- **InstantSign feature**: We have introduced a new feature, InstantSign, that allows users to quickly sign documents online without having the need to go through the identity verification process. In order to make this happen, we will require additional information from customers during Ident-Id creation. This will serve as a much faster eSign solution for AML-compliant customers that have previously stored ident data, and is likely to improve user experience and increase conversions.
- **UX enhancements**: We have made various adjustments to our user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) to ensure users have a seamless experience throughout the flow.
- **Bug fixes**: We regularly test our products to assess areas where there is any room for improvement. We identified some bugs and fixed those as part of this release.


### 8.0.1

Updated the CocoaPods distribution configuration to resolve conflicts related to the Privacy Manifest. This adjustment was necessary due to an issue where the library erroneously included the PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy file in the main bundle, causing build conflicts if two or more pods with the incorrect configuration were used in the integrator app.

### 8.0.0

Apple has introduced some changes in regards to AppStore’s guidelines concerning data collection and API declaration, and this version is being released to ensure that the VideoIdent App/SDK complies with these changes.
A privacy manifest file named PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy has been added to the App’s target resources where we declare the user of certain APIs and explain why they are being used.

**Implications for customers**:

Starting from 01.05.2024, VideoIdent/eID SDK customers that wish to publish a new version of their Host App, have to ensure that they are using the version 8.0.0 or above. (edited)

- **UX enhancements**: We have made numerous adjustments to our user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) to ensure users have a seamless experience throughout the flow.

- **Better memory management**: We have identified some areas of improvement to achieve better memory management and taken the necessary steps to free portions of memory for reuse when no longer needed.
- **Name-matching for eID+QES**: For the eID QES use case, we have introduced an additional check to compare the user's full name specified during Ident ID creation with the full name received from their eID card

### 7.5.0

Update eID intermediary certificate: For our eID solution we have updated the intermediary certificate to match the server certificate

### 6.8.0

Improvements:
- Upgrade the target deployment version: In order to upgrade a deprecated dependency, we have changed the deployment target version from 9.0+ to 11.0+. This change was a prerequisite to upgrading the library.
- Upgrade libPhoneNumber-iOS: Previously the version being used for this library was 0.9.15. Now it has been upgraded to 1.0.4. Unlike in the past, the library will not be installed automatically along with the SDK. Please refer to more information here: pod 'libPhoneNumber-iOS', :git => 'https://github.com/iziz/libPhoneNumber-iOS.git'

- Language selector feature: We have introduced a new feature that will allow end-users to choose their preferred language of identification at the beginning of the flow. The choice will be offered depending on the language(s) configured for each customer and the languages supported by the IDnow call center.
Bug fixes:
- Mismatch area code and country flag: We have fixed an issue whereby we noticed a mismatch between the country flag chosen by the user and the corresponding area code appearing before the number.
- Missing callback: A callback was missing when the user clicked on 'My country is not listed here'. This has been fixed now so that our SDK customers don't face any difficulty displaying the corresponding step/screen to the users.

### 6.7.0

- Addressed deprecated dependencies: There were some dependencies in the iOS SDK that were deprecated. We have addressed these dependencies by either removing them, upgrading them to newer versions and/or building those inside our codebase.
- Configurability for the user of Bluetooth devices: We have now made it possible to configure whether end-users are allowed to perform the VideoIdent and/or eSign process, while being connected to a Bluetooth device. This configurability exists on an OS-level.
- Better control over WebSocket communication: We have enhanced the way we manage WebSocket communication to reduce connectivity issues once the call gets connected to the identification expert.
- Fixed waiting list behavior: We have modified the flow on iOS to match it with Android, so that the connection quality check (CQC) is not performed for users that are already on the waiting list.
- Some crashes have also been identified and fixed to offer end-users a seamless experience


### 6.6.0

- Treating the user's PII data with more care: We have introduced a configurable option to hide the user's PII data so that if a user's Ident ID is somehow accessed by someone else, the user's PII data is not exposed
- eSign wallet expiry use case: A popup is introduced to ensure that the user is informed once their eSign wallet has expired and they need to renew it.
- eSign token expiry use case: A user is only allowed to perform a successful eSign process as long as the token generated from our TSP is valid. In a situation where the token expires, we now show the appropriate messaging to the user so they know how to proceed.
- Dark mode issue: One of our clients had reported that when dark mode was enabled, users were not able to see the radio buttons shown on the Consent Protocol screen that is shown as part of the eSign process. This UI issue has been addressed.
### 6.5.0

- Changes have been made to the SDK in order to enhance the security of communication that takes place between the client and SDK.
- we have wrapped the IDnow SDK as XCFramework. At the moment it is only available for manual implementation. Please check the documentation for details.

### 6.4.0

- Removed PhotoIdent: PhotoIdent was an identification method that was offered as part of our SDK. However, this identification method is obsolete now and no longer being used by our customers. Therefore, we have removed it to reduce the overall SDK size. This will make the integration process easier for our customers.

- UI bug fix: In the eSign flow we noticed a text overlap on the consent protocol screen when the configured documents exceeded a certain number. This bug has been fixed in order to allow our users to seamlessly perform the whole process.


### 6.3.0

Improvement:
- The host URL for a third-party service provider required for the eID identification process has been updated upon the service provider's request. Previously, this URL had been statically specified inside our SDK. As part of this release, not only have we updated it to the new one, we have also made it configurable, so that in the future any changes can be taken care of without the need for a release.

### 6.2.0

Improvement:
- We have upgraded the libraries responsible for enabling the video call in order to offer end-users and identification experts a seamless experience.

Bug fix:
- We have fixed a UI discrepancy on one of the screens that existed when the device/application language was German

### 6.1.5

Improvement:
- For the signing process, we allow additional checkboxes to be configured and displayed to the end-user in case our customers have any regulatory requirement to do so

Bug fix:
- In order to avoid backward compatibility issues resulting from provisioning profiles added by xCode 14, we have now built eID with xCode 13, which enables our customers to build and archive their apps without any issues

### 6.1.4
